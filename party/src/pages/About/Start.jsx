          Party in a Box was started by a group of wild and crazy party enthusiasts who were tired of the hassle of planning and setting up parties. One day, while they were throwing a rager in a forest, they stumbled upon a magical box that, when opened, instantly set up a party complete with decorations, music and snacks. They knew they had to share this magic with the world and thus, Party in a Box was born. They spent months trying to track down the exact location of the box and finally succeeded, they then spent the next few years perfecting the box and making it the best it could be, adding the best features and accessories, testing and adjusting, until they created the greatest party box ever.
